# CircuitPython
My CircuitPython assignments:
## LED Fade
In this assignment I
## Servo Capacitive Touch
For this I
## LCD Screen
Buttons
## Photo Interrupter
In this assignment I learned how to wire the new photo interrupters and how to code for them with circuitpython. In addition, I learned about time monotonic which allows you to 
## Distance Sensor

For most of the sensor code I was able to look at the HCSR04 library we were using to get information.
